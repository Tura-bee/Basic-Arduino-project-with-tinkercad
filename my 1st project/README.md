# Arduino LED Blink (Pin 6)

This is a simple Arduino project that demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to digital pin 6. The LED turns ON for 2 seconds and OFF for 2 seconds in a continuous loop.

## 🛠️ Components Required

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
- LED
- 220Ω resistor (recommended)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## 🔌 Circuit Diagram

1. Connect the **positive (long leg)** of the LED to **digital pin 6** through a **220Ω resistor**.
2. Connect the **negative (short leg)** of the LED to **GND** on the Arduino.
